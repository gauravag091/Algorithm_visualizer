# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that simplifies intricate algorithms by creating intuitive visual representations. It allows users to interact with and manipulate algorithms in real-time, facilitating hands-on learning and experimentation.

## Features

- **Intuitive Visualization:** Abstract algorithms are translated into interactive and engaging visuals.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Crafted using HTML and CSS, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Integrated JavaScript for logic and functionality, allowing users to manipulate algorithms in real-time.
- **Educational Tool:** Prioritize user experience for intuitive learning and experimentation.
  
## Algorithms Supported

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
